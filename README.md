# Localhost Index

Have a bunch of web projects in your ~/Sites (or other-OS equivalent)? Just need a simple way to enumerate them as links so you don't need to 
keep track of them as they get created/removed? OK with PHP? Localhost Index has got your back.

Just put `index.php` in your web project root, make sure your local web server is turned on, and go to http://localhost in a browser.
